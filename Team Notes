Development Requirements
	• Use Pandas to clean and format dataset(s)
	• Create Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process
	• Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis
	• Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at 2 per "question" you ask of your data)
	• Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in the presentation
	• *Optional* - Use at least one API
	• Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data and a short description of. Your finding and any relevant plots

Suggestions for Data (1000-10000 rows)
	• Sufficiently large
	• Have a consistent format
	• Ideally, contain more data than needed
	• Are well-documented
	
Day 1 Deliverables
	• Brainstorm possible project ideas
	• Begin data research
	• Write a description of the scope of your research

		○ Rough breakdown of tasks
			§ Amanda - Data review, data scrub and build dataframes
			§ Rafael - Data review, visualizations, data analysis
			§ Caiti- Data review, visualizations, data analysis
 			§ Yuly - Data review, data scrub and build dataframes
            
Day 2 Plan:
Currently have 8 potential visualizations. Thursday Caiti/Rafael will shares screen and create visuals for first 2.5hrs. Then last 30 we will review for if it tells the story. If not, we'll recircle what data to pull. Troubleshoot early saturday, finalize saturday afternoon.
